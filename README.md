Clusterfy 

Clusterfy is something that I made when I was faced with the issue of organising my hundreds of saved songs into similarly sounding playlists. To make this easier I decided to write code that allows me to place songs into playlists based on how they sound. The script uses Spotify API and the K-means clustering algorithm (hence the name). First, the code was written in R but as I wanted to improve my Python I have decided to set a challenge to make a Python based Flask app using the code I already had.
